# Tic-Tac-Toe-project
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game implemented using Java and JavaFX. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking cells with X or O. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
